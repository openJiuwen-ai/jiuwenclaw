# Gateway And Channels

## Responsibility

Accepts user/channel/front-end input, normalizes it into E2A or legacy-compatible request data, forwards it to AgentServer, receives unary or streamed responses, and dispatches visible output back to the appropriate channel.

## Boundaries

- Owns: channel ingress, Gateway message queues, WebSocket AgentServer client, routing/session map helpers, frontend/TUI transport surfaces.
- Does not own: AgentServer adapter execution, agent tool semantics, or final durable session ownership once delegated to AgentServer.

## Current Evidence

- `jiuwenswarm/gateway/routing/agent_client.py` receives AgentServer frames, routes normal responses by request ID, and treats server-push frames as out-of-band events.
- `docs/en/E2A-protocol.md` describes Gateway -> AgentServer E2A field contracts.
- Tests outside the AgentServer directory cover AgentServer client queueing, reconnect/close behavior, stream tail grace, and timeout policy.
- Gateway reports live channel IDs through `agent.prewarm.sync`. Web/TUI local session creation now proxies AgentServer, IM first contact and `/new_session` allocate before forwarding, and ACP/A2A/SSH retain external IDs only as aliases.
- Web session creation derives `user_id` from the authenticated connection and overwrites any request-body value before forwarding to AgentServer.

## Related Flows

- `gateway-agentserver-e2a-chat` and `agentserver-server-push`
- `agentserver-command-mcp` and `agentserver-sandbox-runtime`
- `agentserver-plan-mode-exit`
- `agentserver-schedule-auto-harness`
- `agentserver-history-stream`
- `session-prewarm-allocation`

## Pending

Full channel integration remains pending, but new-session identity ownership for Web, TUI, controlled IM, ACP, A2A, SSH, and Cron is traced in `session-prewarm-allocation`. The synchronized AgentServer/Web/project/TUI contract suites passed 139 tests on 2026-08-01.
