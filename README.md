## Introduction

**JiuwenSwarm** is an Agent system that makes multi-agent collaboration truly work. Designed for developers and teams who need to automate complex tasks, it helps users drive multi-agent collaboration, Skill self-evolution, and tool invocation through natural language — delivering end-to-end from intent to result. Compared to similar projects, JiuwenSwarm's core differentiators are: Skill self-evolution makes capabilities grow stronger with use, swarm collaboration enables multiple Agents to specialize and coordinate on complex tasks, and multi-platform access covers mainstream IM platforms.

### Why JiuwenSwarm

| Capability | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-Agent Collaboration | Complex tasks are no longer a single Agent's battlefield: Leader automatically decomposes tasks, assembles teams, and multiple Agents specialize and negotiate dynamically |
| Distributed Agent Swarm | Break through single-machine compute limits: Leader/Teammate deploy across processes and machines, coordinating at scale |
| Swarmflow | Orchestrate workflows with natural language: Leader automatically decomposes into multi-stage workflows, with Agents seamlessly handing off between stages |
| Skill Self-Evolution | Capabilities grow stronger with use, not rigid over time: automatically detects error signals and user dissatisfaction, then optimizes Skill definitions |
| Skill Hub Sharing | Capability assets are built once and reused everywhere: Skills can be searched, installed, combined, and remixed across developers |
| Auto Harness | Evaluation-driven, end-to-end automated Harness optimization: not training model weights, but letting the Harness learn and optimize automatically in practice |
| AI Infrastructure Compatibility | One system adapts to multiple inference backends: compatible with Huawei Cloud MaaS and other mainstream platforms, supports OpenAI-compatible APIs and local models |
| Tool Permissions & Security | Every step is under your control: pre-execution approval for tools, file access whitelists, sensitive operation interception |

## Latest Updates

### Start a Conversation

JiuwenSwarm supports three execution modes — switch as needed:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plan Mode | Decomposes requirements into concrete steps, executes step by step | Complex tasks, need to confirm each step |
| Performance Mode | Flexible handling, supports parallel tasks | Simple tasks, fast response |
| Swarm Mode | Leader orchestrates multiple specialized Agents in coordinated collaboration | Large complex tasks, multi-role collaboration |

**Swarm Mode** (default)

Example input:

```text
Conduct an in-depth research on the new energy vehicle industry and generate an analysis report.
```

![JiuwenSwarm Swarm Mode](docs/assets/images/jiuwenswarm集群模式_EN.png)

**Planning Mode**

Example input:

```text
Help me build a personal blog website — from tech selection, page design, frontend and backend development to deployment, create a complete development plan and execute step by step.
```

![JiuwenSwarm Plan Mode](docs/assets/images/jiuwenswarm规划模式_EN.png)

**Performance Mode**

Example input:

```text
Check today's weather in Beijing, and recommend 3 books about artificial intelligence.
```

### TUI Interface

Experience JiuwenSwarm in the terminal — ideal for headless environments or CLI-preferred users.

Example input:

```text
Write a bubble sort algorithm for me.
```
