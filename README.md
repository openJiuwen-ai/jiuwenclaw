| Custom Skills | `.jiuwenclaw/workspace/agent/skills` | Your custom agent skills |
| Configuration | `.jiuwenclaw/config` | Your app settings |

### Migration Steps

After upgrading and running `jiuwenclaw-init`, manually migrate your data:

1. **Copy Memory:**
   ```bash
   cp -r .jiuwenclaw/workspace/agent/memory .jiuwenclaw/agent/memory
   ```

2. **Copy Skills:**
   ```bash
   cp -r .jiuwenclaw/workspace/agent/skills .jiuwenclaw/agent/skills
